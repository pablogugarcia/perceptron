## Setting up the Environment

To set up the project environment, follow the steps below:

1. Create a Conda environment using the provided `env.yml` file:

   ```shell
   conda env create -n perceptron --file env.yml
   ```

   This command will create a new environment named `perceptron` based on the specifications provided in the `env.yml` file.

2. Activate the newly created environment:

   ```shell
   conda activate perceptron
   ```

   This command will activate the `perceptron` environment, allowing you to work within its isolated Python environment.

Now, you have successfully set up the project environment with the required dependencies.

Please note that you need to have Conda installed on your system before proceeding with the above steps.
